## Problem
(Short) Sales differ across regions; we need top products per region, customer segments, and monthly trends.

## Schema
See `sql/01_create_tables.sql` and `sql/02_insert_sample_data.sql`.

## Queries
- Ranking: sql/03_queries_ranking.sql
- Aggregate: sql/04_queries_aggregate.sql
- Navigation: sql/05_queries_navigation.sql
- Distribution: sql/06_queries_distribution.sql

## Key findings
(Write two main findings after you run queries and inspect results, e.g.):
1. Top 5 products in Kigali account for 65% of revenue — consider focusing inventory.
2. Top 10% customers generate 45% of revenue — recommend VIP loyalty program.

## Screenshots
All SQL results are saved in the `screenshots` folder (20+ images).

## Integrity statement
All work in this repository is my original work. I used documentation and tutorials (listed in references). I did not copy AI-generated text without citation.
